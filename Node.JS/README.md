    ## What is Node JS
        ### node js is an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime, Node.js is designed to build scalable network applications.

            #### Powerful javascript Runtime
            #### Develop on Chrome's V8 JavaScrip Engine
            #### Used for creating server side web applications, where somthing faster and more scalable is required
            #### NodeJS Uses JavaScript on the server End
            #### It Can connect with Database
            #### cross-platform run-time environment for applications
            #### NodeJS has many different framwork like Salis.js, Partial.js and Express.js
            #### it can generating database queries
        
        ## Why Node.js is popular among developers.
            ### 1. It is easy to learn Node.js.
                #### as a developer JavaScript  skills are common. JodeJs uses JavaScrip. So learning NodeJS is relatively easy.
            ### 2. The scalability offered.
                #### Node.js can handle many concurrent requests. This is the main reason it quickly became popular among developers and large companies. It can handle many simultaneous (at a time) requests without straining the server. A callback is fired only after a request. Node.js is only online when needed. This avoids unnecessary usage of your RAM.
            ### 3. The Mobile-friendly, Cross-platform, and Dev-Friendly nature of Node.js.
                #### it's run smoothly on any platform, be it Linux, Windows or Mac. There has been a rise in cross-platform app development in the last few years. It has enabled developers to write apps that run on different platforms with little or no modifications being made.
            ### 4. Node.js is light and fast.
                #### Node.js uses Googleâ€™s V8 JavaScript engine which is built in C++. The engine is an open source and high-performance JavaScript and WebAssembly engine. V8 engine handles memory allocation, compiles, and executes JavaScript. It compiles JavaScript into machine code using a just-in-time (JIT) compiler before executing it.


    ## Type : Interpreter and Environment for javaScript
    ## Utility: Node. js is primarily used for non-blocking, event-driven servers, due to its single-threaded nature.
    ## Running Engine : V8 ( Google Chrome )

    ## Benifit of Useng NodeJS : 
        ### Open Source
        ### Simple & Fast
        ### Asynchronous
        ### High Scalability
        ### Single Threaded
        ### No Buffering
        ### Cross Platform
