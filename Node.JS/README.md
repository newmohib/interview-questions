# Node JS Interview Questions


## What is Node JS

### node js is an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime, Node.js is designed to build scalable network applications.

#### Powerful javascript Runtime
#### Develop on Chrome's V8 JavaScrip Engine
#### Used for creating server side web applications, where somthing faster and more scalable is required
#### NodeJS Uses JavaScript on the server End
#### It Can connect with Database
#### cross-platform run-time environment for applications
#### NodeJS has many different framwork like Salis.js, Partial.js and Express.js
#### it can generating database queries
        
## Why Node.js is popular among developers ?

### 1. It is easy to learn Node.js.

#### as a developer JavaScript  skills are common. JodeJs uses JavaScrip. So learning NodeJS is relatively easy.

### 2. The scalability offered.

#### Node.js can handle many concurrent requests. This is the main reason it quickly became popular among developers and large companies. It can handle many simultaneous (at a time) requests without straining the server. A callback is fired only after a request. Node.js is only online when needed. This avoids unnecessary usage of your RAM.

### 3. The Mobile-friendly, Cross-platform, and Dev-Friendly nature of Node.js.

#### it's run smoothly on any platform, be it Linux, Windows or Mac. There has been a rise in cross-platform app development in the last few years. It has enabled developers to write apps that run on different platforms with little or no modifications being made.

### 4. Node.js is light and fast.

#### Node.js uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine which is built in C++. The engine is an open source and high-performance JavaScript and WebAssembly engine. V8 engine handles memory allocation, compiles, and executes JavaScript. It compiles JavaScript into machine code using a just-in-time (JIT) compiler before executing it.

### 5. Highly extensible.

#### Node.js does not provide everything. we can customize or add what you need over time. Npm is the default package manager in Node.js. Here, we can browse and install over 1 million open source packages. 

### 6. Its caching ability

#### Node.js provides the ability to cache single modules. Caching is the storage of data for future requests. When a request involving the module is made, it is fetched from the cache instead of the main servers. Thus, the app loads faster and responds quicker.

### 7. what kind of apps can I make with Node.js ?

####  Node.js can be used to make almost any kind of app.

##### A: Single-page applications (SPA). eg. portfolio etc.
##### B: Social media applications. LinkedIn uses Node.js.
##### C: Real-time apps like chat apps.
##### D: Streaming apps. For example, Netflix.
##### E: Ecommerce apps. For example, Walmart.
##### F: Blogs.
##### G: Online Payment systems. For example, PayPal
##### H: Ecommerce apps. For example, Walmart. and APIs. etc

## The advantages of using Node.js ?

##### 1. Node.js modules and tools are easily available via Npm
##### 2. Strong community
##### 3. It can be used to build a wide range of apps.
##### 4. It’s Cross-platform and mobile-friendly.
##### 5. Hosting Node.js is not a hassle due to many of its supported hosting platforms.
##### 6. It’s lightweight.
##### 7. It has the ability to handle many requests at a time.
##### 8. Fast code execution.
##### 9. Open Source
##### 10. Simple & Fast
##### 11. Asynchronous
##### 12. High Scalability
##### 13. Single Threaded
##### 14. No Buffering
##### 15. Cross Platform

## Type : Interpreter and Environment for javaScript
## Utility: Node. js is primarily used for non-blocking, event-driven servers, due to its single-threaded nature.

## Blocking vs Non-Blocking in Node.js.

### 1. Blocking
